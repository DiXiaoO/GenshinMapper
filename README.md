# GenshinMapper  
This repository contains a script that allows you to quickly create a mod for your map.  

At the moment the script only works with 3 scenes!  

## Usage  
To use the script, follow these steps:  

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Replace *map**World/Chasm/Enkanomiya**.png* with your desired image in the project folder.  
3. Make sure you have PIL library installed since it is required to run the mapper.py script.  
4. Run *mapper**World/Chasm/Enkanomiya**.py* script using Python.  
5. After running the script, images for the mod will appear in an "MapMod**World/Chasm/Enkanomiya**" folder within project directory.  
6. Transfer resulting files from "MapMod**World/Chasm/Enkanomiya**" folder to map's folder in MapMod**World/Chasm/Enkanomiya** directory.  
7. Load the mod as you would with any other normal 3DMigoto mod (Link: https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer).  
8. Enjoy and explore your modified map!
